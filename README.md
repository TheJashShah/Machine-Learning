# Projects
 1. Student-Score-Predictor

    extremely simple project done only for confidence and to get a hang of using a somewhat real-life dataset.
    R2_score: 0.988

 2. Taxi-Price-Predictor

    Used Linear regression on a taxi-price dataset, which required cleaning, manually encoding categorical columns, and min-max scaling numerical columns.
    R2_score: ~0.83

 3. Wine-Quality-Predictor

    Used a wine dataset that contains chemical details of wine samples to predict whether a wine is 'good' or 'bad'. (Regression performed badly, so used random-forest classifier).

 4. Titanic-Survival-Predictor

     Used Logistic Regression to predict whether a person lived or died on titanic, dataset from the Kaggle competition.
